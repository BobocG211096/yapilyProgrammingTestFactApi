Coding Challenge - Facts API - v1

Created an application which runs an embedded Tomcat server already 
configured by the spring framework starting on the port 8080. To run
the application use the command **mvn spring-boot:run**. After all is up
and running you need to have access the the REST API, in this way in the application.yml
I have set the apiKey and the header name which you have to use for accessing the endpoint.

Thus the header name will be **ApiKey** and the api key will be **329e225d-1d37-4a7e-8d95-3e7c5e623ffd**.
